## 📝 Abstract (730 characters)

> Mixture of Experts (MoE) models achieve state-of-the-art performance across various domains but suffer from poor GPU utilization due to sparse expert activation patterns. We propose Expert-Sliced GPU Scheduling, a novel system that dynamically partitions GPU resources based on runtime profiling of expert usage. Our approach combines three key innovations: (1) Triton-optimized kernels for fused expert computation, (2) CUDA graph-based execution for reduced kernel launch overhead, and (3) dynamic GPU slice allocation aligned with expert routing sparsity. Experiments on NVIDIA A100/H100 GPUs demonstrate 1.8-2.4× throughput improvement and 35-45% energy efficiency gains compared to standard MoE implementations, while maintaining model accuracy.
