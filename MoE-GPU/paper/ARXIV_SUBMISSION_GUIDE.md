#### Abstract:
```
Mixture of Experts (MoE) models achieve state-of-the-art performance across various domains but suffer from poor GPU utilization due to sparse expert activation patterns. We propose Expert-Sliced GPU Scheduling, a novel system that dynamically partitions GPU resources based on runtime profiling of expert usage. Our approach combines three key innovations: (1) Triton-optimized kernels for fused expert computation, (2) CUDA graph-based execution for reduced kernel launch overhead, and (3) dynamic GPU slice allocation aligned with expert routing sparsity. Experiments on NVIDIA A100/H100 GPUs demonstrate 1.8-2.4√ó throughput improvement and 35-45% energy efficiency gains compared to standard MoE implementations, while maintaining model accuracy.
```

**Note:** Abstract must be under 1920 characters (currently ~730)

#### Comments: (Optional)
```
17 pages, 6 tables, 2 algorithms. Code available at https://github.com/yourusername/moe-gpu-scheduling
```

### Step 7: Review and Submit

1. **Preview** the rendered PDF
2. Check all metadata is correct
3. Review the license (default: arXiv.org perpetual license)
4. Click **"Submit"**

### Step 8: Moderation

- arXiv moderators review submissions (usually 24-48 hours)
- You'll receive an email when approved
- Paper will be published the next business day

## üìÖ arXiv Schedule

**Submission Deadlines** (US Eastern Time):
- **Sunday - Thursday**: 14:00 (2 PM) ‚Üí Announced next day
- **Friday**: 14:00 (2 PM) ‚Üí Announced Monday

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Error: "TeX capacity exceeded"

**Solution:** Your paper is too large. Try:
```latex
% Add to preamble
\usepackage[draft]{graphicx}  % Don't include images
```

### Error: "File not found: XXX.sty"

**Solution:** Include the style file in your submission or use standard packages

### Error: "Undefined control sequence"

**Solution:** Check all custom commands are defined in the preamble

### Warning: "Overfull \hbox"

**Solution:** These are usually safe to ignore. They mean text extends slightly into margins.

### Error: "Cannot compile"

**Solution:** Test locally first:
```bash
pdflatex research_paper.tex
# Check the .log file for errors
```
