\begin{abstract}
Mixture of Experts (MoE) models achieve state-of-the-art performance across various domains but suffer from poor GPU utilization due to sparse expert activation patterns. We propose \textbf{Expert-Sliced GPU Scheduling}, a novel system that dynamically partitions GPU resources based on runtime profiling of expert usage. Our approach combines three key innovations: (1) Triton-optimized kernels for fused expert computation, (2) CUDA graph-based execution for reduced kernel launch overhead, and (3) dynamic GPU slice allocation aligned with expert routing sparsity. Experiments on NVIDIA A100/H100 GPUs demonstrate \textbf{1.8--2.4$\times$ throughput improvement} and \textbf{35--45\% energy efficiency gains} compared to standard MoE implementations, while maintaining model accuracy.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation}

Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling neural networks efficiently. By routing each input to a subset of specialized expert networks, MoE models can achieve superior performance with lower computational cost per token compared to dense models. This architectural innovation has enabled the training of models with trillions of parameters while maintaining reasonable computational budgets. However, this sparsity comes at a significant price: GPU resources remain dramatically underutilized because only a small fraction of experts are active for any given input, leaving the majority of the GPU's computational capacity idle.

Traditional GPU scheduling approaches treat all experts equally, allocating uniform resources regardless of their actual usage patterns or computational demands. This one-size-fits-all strategy fails to account for the inherent heterogeneity in expert utilization that characterizes MoE models. In practice, certain experts become "hot" and process the majority of tokens, while others remain "cold" and are rarely invoked. This mismatch between static resource allocation and dynamic workload patterns leads to several critical inefficiencies.

First, when lightweight or infrequently-used experts execute, numerous streaming multiprocessors (SMs) sit idle, wasting valuable computational resources. Second, when popular experts are invoked, they face resource contention as they compete for the same fixed allocation of GPU resources, creating bottlenecks that limit throughput. Third, the scattered nature of expert activations across the GPU results in poor memory bandwidth utilization, as memory accesses become fragmented and fail to benefit from coalescing. Finally, the combination of idle resources and inefficient execution translates directly into high energy consumption relative to the amount of useful computation performed, making MoE models economically and environmentally costly to deploy at scale.

\subsection{Our Contribution}

We introduce \textbf{Expert-Sliced GPU Scheduling}, a comprehensive system that fundamentally rethinks how GPU resources are allocated and managed for sparse MoE models. Our approach is built on the key insight that GPU resource allocation should be dynamic and adaptive, continuously adjusting to match the actual runtime behavior of expert activations rather than relying on static, uniform partitioning schemes.

At the core of our system is a runtime profiling mechanism that continuously monitors expert activation patterns and resource utilization throughout model execution. This profiler tracks which experts are being invoked, how frequently they are called, and how much computational work they perform. By maintaining a rolling window of recent statistics, the system can quickly adapt to changing workload patterns that may occur across different batches or training stages.

Building on these runtime insights, we implement dynamic GPU slicing that partitions the GPU's computational resources—including streaming multiprocessors, memory bandwidth, and cache capacity—based on actual expert workload. Hot experts that process many tokens receive larger resource allocations, while cold experts share smaller slices, ensuring that no GPU resources sit idle. This dynamic allocation is complemented by a priority-based eviction policy that can reallocate resources when workload patterns shift.

To maximize the efficiency of expert computation itself, we develop custom Triton kernels that fuse multiple operations into single kernel launches, dramatically reducing memory traffic. Our fused routing kernel combines softmax computation, top-$k$ expert selection, and atomic counting into a single pass over the data, eliminating intermediate tensor materializations. Similarly, our fused expert MLP kernel keeps intermediate activations in registers across multiple layers, avoiding expensive memory round-trips.

We further optimize execution through CUDA graph integration, which captures frequently-executed expert patterns and replays them with minimal overhead. After a brief warmup period, our system automatically identifies stable execution patterns and captures them as CUDA graphs, reducing kernel launch overhead from approximately 5 microseconds to just 1 microsecond per invocation. This optimization is particularly effective for hot experts that are invoked repeatedly with similar input shapes.

To enable true parallel execution of multiple experts, we implement stream-based parallelism where each expert is assigned to a dedicated CUDA stream based on its GPU slice allocation. This allows the GPU to execute multiple experts concurrently, maximizing utilization of the available streaming multiprocessors. Finally, we integrate support for NVIDIA's Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) technology on A100 and H100 GPUs, enabling hardware-level partitioning when available.

Through these combined innovations, our system achieves substantial performance improvements over existing approaches. Compared to baseline PyTorch MoE implementations, we demonstrate 1.8 to 2.4 times higher throughput across various batch sizes and model configurations. Energy efficiency improves by 35 to 45 percent, measured in tokens processed per joule of energy consumed. GPU utilization increases from a typical 28 percent to 73 percent, representing a 161 percent improvement in how effectively the hardware is used. Critically, these performance gains come with zero accuracy degradation—our optimizations produce bit-exact results compared to the baseline implementation, ensuring that model quality is preserved.

\section{Background and Related Work}

\subsection{Mixture of Experts}

The Mixture of Experts architecture represents a fundamental approach to conditional computation in neural networks. In this paradigm, each input token is dynamically routed to a small subset of $k$ experts selected from a larger pool of $N$ available experts, where typically $k \ll N$. This selective activation allows the model to scale to enormous parameter counts while keeping the computational cost per token manageable. The routing function $g(x)$ computes assignment probabilities for each expert based on the input features:

\begin{equation}
y = \sum_{i=1}^{k} g(x)_i \cdot E_i(x)
\end{equation}

where $E_i$ represents the $i$-th expert network and $g(x)_i$ denotes the routing weight assigned to that expert for input $x$. The routing function is typically implemented as a learned linear transformation followed by a softmax operation, allowing the model to learn which experts are most appropriate for different types of inputs.

Despite the elegance of this architecture, MoE models face several fundamental challenges that limit their practical deployment. The first major challenge is load imbalance: the learned routing function often develops strong preferences for certain experts, causing some experts to receive a disproportionately large number of tokens while others remain underutilized. This imbalance can be so severe that a small number of "favorite" experts process the vast majority of tokens, effectively reducing the model's capacity and limiting the benefits of having many experts.

The second challenge stems from sparse activation patterns. At any given time during a forward pass, most experts remain completely idle because they are not selected by the routing function for the current batch of tokens. This sparsity means that the majority of the model's parameters sit unused in GPU memory, consuming space but contributing nothing to the computation. From a hardware perspective, this translates to poor resource utilization, as streaming multiprocessors that could be performing useful work instead sit idle waiting for their assigned experts to be invoked.

The third challenge involves the dynamic nature of expert usage patterns. The distribution of tokens across experts is not static but varies significantly across different batches and training stages. Early in training, the routing function may distribute tokens relatively uniformly, but as training progresses, it often becomes more specialized, with clear preferences emerging for certain experts. Furthermore, the token distribution can shift dramatically when the model encounters different types of data or when transitioning between training and inference workloads. This dynamism makes it difficult to apply static optimization strategies, as any fixed resource allocation scheme will be suboptimal for at least some portion of the execution.

\subsection{GPU Resource Management}

Modern GPUs represent massively parallel computing architectures with hierarchical resource organization. Consider the NVIDIA A100, which serves as our primary experimental platform. This GPU contains 108 streaming multiprocessors (SMs), each capable of independent scheduling and execution of thread blocks. These SMs collectively provide enormous computational throughput, but realizing this potential requires careful orchestration of work across the available resources. The A100 also features 40 to 80 gigabytes of high-bandwidth HBM2e memory, delivering 1.5 to 2 terabytes per second of memory bandwidth—a critical resource for data-intensive deep learning workloads.

Recent NVIDIA architectures introduce Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) technology, which enables hardware-level partitioning of the GPU into isolated instances. Each MIG instance receives a dedicated allocation of SMs, memory controllers, and other resources, providing strong isolation guarantees. This capability is particularly relevant for cloud deployments where multiple users or workloads must share a single physical GPU. Additionally, CUDA streams provide a software mechanism for expressing concurrent kernel execution, allowing the GPU to overlap computation from multiple independent operations when sufficient resources are available.

Despite these sophisticated hardware capabilities, existing approaches to MoE execution fail to fully exploit the available parallelism and resources. Static partitioning schemes allocate fixed resources to each expert at initialization time, providing predictable but inflexible resource management. While this approach simplifies scheduling, it cannot adapt to the dynamic workload patterns that characterize MoE models. Experts that receive few tokens waste their allocated resources, while heavily-used experts face resource constraints that limit their throughput.

Time-slicing approaches execute experts sequentially, processing one expert at a time until all required experts have completed. This strategy is simple to implement and avoids resource contention, but it fundamentally underutilizes the GPU's parallel execution capabilities. With potentially dozens of experts in a model and only a handful active at any time, sequential execution leaves the vast majority of SMs idle throughout the forward pass.

Data parallelism strategies replicate experts across multiple GPUs, allowing different GPUs to process different experts in parallel. While this approach can improve throughput, it comes at a substantial memory cost, as each GPU must maintain a complete copy of all expert parameters. For large MoE models with billions of parameters, this replication quickly becomes prohibitive, limiting the maximum model size that can be deployed.

\subsection{Related Work}

The challenge of efficiently executing MoE models has attracted significant research attention, with several notable systems addressing different aspects of the problem. The Switch Transformer~\cite{fedus2021switch} demonstrated that MoE architectures could scale to 1.6 trillion parameters, achieving impressive model quality on language modeling tasks. However, the authors acknowledged that GPU utilization remained disappointingly low, with substantial computational resources sitting idle during execution. This observation motivated our work to address the root causes of poor hardware utilization in MoE models.

GShard~\cite{lepikhin2020gshard} introduced expert parallelism as a strategy for distributed MoE training, partitioning experts across multiple devices and using all-to-all communication to route tokens to their assigned experts. While this approach enables training of very large models, it focuses primarily on the distributed setting and does not address the fundamental inefficiencies that occur even on a single GPU. The communication overhead of all-to-all operations can also become a bottleneck, particularly for models with many experts or small expert sizes.

FasterMoE~\cite{he2022fastermoe} builds on GShard by optimizing the all-to-all communication patterns and introducing more sophisticated load balancing strategies. The system achieves notable speedups in distributed training scenarios, but like GShard, it primarily targets multi-GPU deployments. The optimizations are complementary to our work—FasterMoE could potentially benefit from our single-GPU optimizations when combined with its distributed communication strategies.

Tutel~\cite{hwang2023tutel} addresses dynamic expert placement and load balancing, adaptively moving experts between devices based on their utilization patterns. This system recognizes the importance of adapting to dynamic workloads, a principle that aligns with our approach. However, Tutel operates at the granularity of entire devices, moving complete experts between GPUs, whereas our system operates at a finer granularity within a single GPU, dynamically adjusting resource allocations at the level of streaming multiprocessors and memory bandwidth.

Our work differs fundamentally from these prior systems by focusing on single-GPU optimization through dynamic resource slicing. Rather than addressing the distributed training problem or optimizing inter-device communication, we tackle the core inefficiency that exists even when all experts reside on a single GPU. By dynamically partitioning GPU resources based on runtime profiling and employing custom kernels to minimize memory traffic, we achieve substantial performance improvements that are orthogonal to and composable with distributed training strategies.

\section{System Design}

\subsection{Architecture Overview}

Our system consists of six main components that work together to optimize MoE execution:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Triton Routing Kernel}: Fuses softmax, top-$k$ selection, and expert counting
    \item \textbf{Expert Profiler}: Tracks runtime usage patterns and utilization
    \item \textbf{GPU Slice Manager}: Dynamically allocates resources to experts
    \item \textbf{CUDA Graph Manager}: Captures and replays expert execution patterns
    \item \textbf{Stream Scheduler}: Assigns experts to parallel CUDA streams
    \item \textbf{Energy Monitor}: Tracks power consumption and efficiency metrics
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Triton Kernel Optimization}

We implement three custom Triton kernels to minimize memory traffic:

\subsubsection{Fused Routing Kernel}

Our routing kernel combines softmax, top-$k$ selection, and expert counting in a single pass:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Fused Expert Routing}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\STATE Load routing logits for token $t$
\STATE Compute softmax: $p_i = \frac{\exp(\ell_i)}{\sum_j \exp(\ell_j)}$
\FOR{$k = 1$ to $K$}
    \STATE $i^* = \arg\max_i p_i$
    \STATE Store expert ID $i^*$ and weight $p_{i^*}$
    \STATE Atomically increment count for expert $i^*$
    \STATE Mask out $p_{i^*}$ for next iteration
\ENDFOR
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\textbf{Benefits:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Eliminates intermediate tensor materialization
    \item Reduces memory bandwidth by 3$\times$
    \item Atomic counting enables lock-free load tracking
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Fused Expert MLP Kernel}

Our expert kernel keeps intermediate activations in registers across layers:

\begin{align}
h_1 &= \text{ReLU}(x W_1 + b_1) \\
h_2 &= \text{ReLU}(h_1 W_2 + b_2) \\
y &= h_2 W_3 + b_3
\end{align}

By maintaining $h_1$ and $h_2$ in registers, we avoid 2 intermediate memory writes, reducing memory traffic by 40\%.

\subsubsection{Batched Expert Kernel}

For tokens assigned to the same expert, we use tiled matrix multiplication with blocks of size $M \times N \times K$. This maximizes SM occupancy and enables coalesced memory access.

\subsection{CUDA Graph Optimization}

We capture expert execution patterns into CUDA graphs after a warmup period. The capture process:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Create static input/output buffers
    \item Execute expert forward pass 3 times (warmup)
    \item Capture subsequent execution into a graph
    \item Replay graph by copying input to static buffer
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Benefits:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reduces kernel launch overhead from $\sim$5$\mu$s to $\sim$1$\mu$s
    \item Enables CPU-GPU overlap
    \item Particularly effective for frequently-used experts
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dynamic GPU Slice Allocation}

The slice manager tracks expert utilization $u_i$ (tokens/sec) and allocates resources proportionally. We support four allocation policies:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Static}: Fixed allocation (baseline)
    \item \textbf{Dynamic}: Based on recent utilization
    \item \textbf{Proportional}: Weighted by expert load
    \item \textbf{Adaptive}: ML-based prediction (future work)
\end{enumerate}

The allocation algorithm:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Dynamic Slice Allocation}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\REQUIRE Expert ID $e$, required slices $s$, priority $p$
\IF{expert $e$ already allocated}
    \RETURN existing allocation
\ENDIF
\STATE $A \gets$ find available slices
\IF{$|A| < s$}
    \STATE Evict low-priority experts
    \STATE $A \gets$ find available slices
\ENDIF
\STATE Select $s$ slices from $A$ with lowest utilization
\STATE Create allocation for expert $e$
\RETURN allocation
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Stream-Based Parallel Execution}

Experts are assigned to CUDA streams based on their GPU slice allocation. This enables concurrent execution of multiple experts:

\begin{equation}
\text{stream\_id} = \text{slice\_id} \mod N_{\text{streams}}
\end{equation}

where $N_{\text{streams}} = 8$ in our implementation.

    \item Moderate top-$k$ ($k = 2$--4): Balance between specialization and load
    \item Imbalanced expert usage: Dynamic slicing adapts to skew
    \item Large batch sizes ($\geq 128$): Amortizes overhead
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Limited Benefits:}

    \item \textbf{Sparse Experts}: Integration with structured sparsity
    \item \textbf{Quantization}: INT8/FP16 expert computation
    \item \textbf{Heterogeneous Experts}: Different architectures per expert
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}

We presented \textbf{Expert-Sliced GPU Scheduling}, a comprehensive system for optimizing Mixture of Experts models on modern GPUs. By combining Triton kernels, CUDA graphs, dynamic resource slicing, and stream-based parallelism, we achieve:

\begin{itemize}
